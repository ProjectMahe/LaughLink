## 🎯 Inspiration
We wanted to create something that wasn’t just fun but also interactive — where friends (and strangers!) could compete in the ultimate showdown of wit using memes.  
After all, laughter *is* the best multiplayer game.

## 🤹‍♂️ What it does
- Players join meme battles in real time.
- One player is given a meme template, others compete by adding captions.
- Everyone votes for the funniest meme.
- Points are awarded and the leaderboard updates live.

- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django) for API and WebSocket real-time events.
- **Frontend:** HTML + CSS (Responsive for Desktop & Mobile) + JavaScript.
